    <h3>👨🏾‍💻Paseka's Coding Journey</h3>
  </summary>
  Back in high school, I stumbled onto Python while browsing youtube. I was immediately intrested in the idea of creating something just from typing words. Then came university, where everyone seemed like coding geniuses. Math wasn't my strong suit, but I knew I had to buckle down. Instead of just doing school projects, I started building stuff on the side. Each project was like a fun challenge, teaching me loads. My big goal? Either start my own tech company or snag a sweet-paying job. Either way, I'm on a journey, learning with every line of code.
